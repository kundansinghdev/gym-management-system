# gym-management-system
The provided C++ code represents a Gym Management System with the following key features:

1. **Password Protection**: Users must input a predefined password ("pass") to access the system.

2. **Main Menu**:
   - **Add Members**: Users can add new gym members by specifying their category
   - (New Member, Coach, Staff), ID, name, address, contact, and membership start date. The member data is stored in a binary file named `stf.dat`.

   - **Remove Members**: Allows users to delete gym member records by searching for a member's ID and confirming the deletion.

   - **Search Members**: Provides options to search for gym members either by their ID or name. If found, the system displays the member's details.

   - **View Member's List**: Displays a list of all gym members, showing their category, ID, name, address, contact, and membership start date.

   - **Edit Members Record**: Users can edit a member's record by providing their ID, allowing modifications to details such as name, address, contact, and membership start date.

   - **Close Application**: Exits the program.

3. **Data Storage**: Member data is stored in a binary file (`stf.dat`).

4. **Password Verification**: The system verifies the entered password to grant access to the main menu.

Please note that this code is a simple and rudimentary representation of a Gym Management System. In a real-world application,
you would need to enhance it with error handling, data validation, modern C++ practices, and potentially a graphical user interface (GUI) 
to make it more user-friendly and robust. Additionally, consider using a database instead of a binary file for better data management and security.
